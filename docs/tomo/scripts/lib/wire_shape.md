# WHY: lib/wire_shape.py

> Rationale for decisions in `tomo/scripts/lib/wire_shape.py`.
> The shape manifest that lets a wire-schema change be caught before a consumer is.

## WHY This Module Exists (spec 035 F1)

The check it replaces walked a schema too shallowly: on a document with no
reusable `$defs` block — exactly the shape of the document that drifted —
it compared nothing and passed vacuously. `describe_shape` walks every
object node reachable from the schema root, whatever route reaches it, so
the manifest cannot go blind just because a document inlines its objects.

## WHY Effective Openness, Not Literal

`closed` is `node.get("additionalProperties") is False` — not "whatever the
key holds" and not "False when the key is absent." A JSON-Schema node with
no `additionalProperties` declared is permissive by the spec's own default;
recording the literal value (`None`) would misclassify every node that
never declared it as neither open nor closed, and Phase 2's classifier
needs a clean boolean to decide whether an added property is
consumer-affecting. Recording the effective value is what keeps that
classification honest — see ADR-4, which reads `closed` off this field
rather than re-deriving it.

## WHY Types Are Recorded and Descriptions Are Not (ADR-2)

The eight-class change matrix behind this spec measured a type change as
consumer-affecting on its own — emitting `null` where a consumer's
validator expects `string` errors regardless of whether the containing node
is open or closed. Excluding types would leave that breakage invisible, so
`properties` maps each name to its declared `type` keyword.

Descriptions and titles are left out deliberately, not by oversight: the
consumer's validator ignores prose, so recording it would fail the check on
every edit that obliges nobody — which is the exact noise pattern that
makes a detector go unread. The exclusion line is drawn where the churn is
(descriptions change constantly), not where recording is cheapest. This is
also PRD/F1-AC4: a description- or title-only edit must produce an
identical manifest, which only holds if prose never entered the recorded
shape in the first place.

## WHY an Undeclared Type Gets a Placeholder, Not an Omission

`(child or {}).get("type", "any")` always inserts a key for every property
name, even when the property's own subschema carries no `type` keyword (for
example a bare `{"description": "..."}`, or a node built purely from
`allOf`/`$ref`). Omitting the key instead of recording `"any"` would make a
manifest diff between "this property has never had a type" and "this
property's type keyword was just deleted" look identical — both would show
up as a missing dict key rather than as two distinct, nameable states.

## WHY Pointers Carry a `properties` Segment (deviation from the SDD's illustrative code)

The first cut walked `f"{pointer}/{name}"` for a property child — a bare
name appended directly, with no `properties` segment — matching the code
block in solution.md's Implementation Examples verbatim. That code block is
illustrative, not authoritative, and the bare form turned out to be wrong:
a schema with a property literally named `items` (or `contains`, `$defs`,
`definitions`, `allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`) collides with the sibling
structural keyword of the same name, because both paths append that literal
segment to the same parent pointer. Measured directly: a schema with a
property `items` alongside a real array `items` keyword produced 2 nodes
where 3 were expected — the second overwrote the first in the `nodes` dict.
That is the precise failure class this spec exists to eliminate ("a walk
that visited too little"), just relocated from missing branches to
colliding pointers.

Real RFC 6901 pointers — `f"{pointer}/properties/{name}"` — are collision-free
because `properties` is never itself a valid property *name* collision
target in the same way: the segment sequence `.../properties/items` cannot
be produced by the structural-keyword branches (`items`, `$defs/…`, etc.),
which append `items`, `$defs/<name>`, `allOf/<i>`, and so on directly. This
also matches T1.3's own validation gate, which names
`/properties/suggestions/items` literally, and the SDD's own walkthrough
table (`/properties/findings/items/properties/detail`), which already used
the mid-path `properties` segment the illustrative code block omitted. See
the plan's Deviation Log (`plan/README.md`) for the approval record.

If a later reader is tempted to "simplify" the pointer back to the bare
form for readability: don't — that is exactly the change that reintroduces
silent node loss, and the regression test
(`test_property_named_items_does_not_collide_with_items_keyword`) exists to
catch it.

## WHY the Walk Covers `items`/`contains`, `$defs`/`definitions`, and
`allOf`/`anyOf`/`oneOf` — and Nothing Else

These are precisely the routes a real object node can be reached by in the
three published wire schemas this spec covers: an object nested inside an
array (`items`, and `contains` for the tuple form), an object registered as
a reusable definition (`$defs`, and `definitions` for the older keyword
still present in one schema), and an object introduced through schema
composition (`allOf`/`anyOf`/`oneOf`). The bug this spec fixes was a walk
that visited too little, not a walk that needed a keyword no wire actually
uses — so the set stays exactly this list rather than growing to cover
every JSON-Schema composition keyword in the abstract.

## WHY the Return Value Is the Nodes Map, Not the Manifest Entity

The SDD's `ShapeManifest` entity carries `schema_version` and `source`
alongside `nodes` — those are properties of the *file* a manifest is
written to, not of the schema being walked, and `describe_shape` has no
file to read them from. Assembling `ShapeManifest` is T1.2's job, which
also decides where `schema_version` and `source` come from for a given
wire. `describe_shape` stays a pure function of one schema dict in, one
`dict[pointer, NodeShape]` out — no I/O, so the same function can describe
a schema loaded from disk, a scratch dict built for a test (as in the
counterfactual pre-032 garden-audit walkthrough in solution.md), or a
consumer's vendored copy, without needing to know which.

## WHY `diff_shapes` and `classify` Are Not Here Yet

They are Phase 2 (T2.x). This module currently exposes only
`describe_shape` in `__all__`; a reader who finds the module's surface
partial should not read that as an oversight — the plan sequences shape
description before shape comparison so each has its own RED-GREEN cycle
against its own acceptance criteria (F1 here, F2 in Phase 2).
