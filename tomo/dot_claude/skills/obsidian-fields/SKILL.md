# Obsidian Fields
# version: 0.1.1

Knowledge patterns for handling Obsidian frontmatter, relationships, callouts, and tags.

## Frontmatter Handling

Frontmatter is described in `vault-config.yaml` under `frontmatter:` with `required` and `optional` field lists and a `strict` flag.

**Field definition properties:**
- `key` — the YAML key name in the note (e.g., `UUID`, `title`, `tags`)
- `token` — template token that resolves the value (e.g., `uuid`, `title`, `datestamp`)
- `format` — expected format for generated values (e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYYMMDDHHmmss`)
- `type` — expected YAML type: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `list`, `date`
- `default` — fallback for optional fields when the token cannot resolve

**Required fields:**
- If a required token cannot resolve → rendering fails, error in instruction set
- Tomo never writes a note that would break the required schema
- Empty value (`title: ""`) counts as missing when `strict: true`

**Optional fields:**
- Token resolves → use it
- Token fails + default set → use default
- Token fails + no default → omit the field entirely

**Detection during `/explore-vault`:**
- Sample 50 notes (configurable)
- Fields in >90% of notes → propose as `required`
- Fields in 10-90% → propose as `optional`
- Fields in <10% → mention but don't add
- Format and type inferred from observed values

**Format grammar (Moment.js subset):**
- `YYYY` — 4-digit year, `MM` — 2-digit month, `DD` — 2-digit day
- `HH` — 24-hour hour, `mm` — minute, `ss` — second
- Example: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm` → `2026-04-07 14:30`
- UUID: `YYYYMMDDHHmmss` → `20260407143045`

**Validation at render time:**
1. All required keys are present
2. Types match declared types (lenient — string is ok where text is expected)
3. Formats match for generated fields
4. The YAML parses without error

**Unknown fields:** Never remove or modify fields not in the schema. Schema constrains what Tomo writes, not what it tolerates. Pass through all unknown fields unchanged.

**Frontmatter position:** Obsidian requires frontmatter at position 0. If content appears before the `---` fence, treat the note as having no frontmatter and warn.

**YAML resilience:** Pre-process potentially malformed YAML before parsing: normalize tabs to spaces, fix common indentation errors, quote bare strings containing `:`, auto-close unclosed sequences. If the fixer fails, pass broken YAML + error to a short LLM prompt: "Fix this YAML so it parses correctly. Only fix syntax, don't change values."

## Relationship Markers

Relationships between notes are described in `vault-config.yaml` under `relationships:` with `parent` and `peer` relationship types (and optionally custom types).

**Relationship properties:**
- `marker` — prefix identifying this relationship when reading (e.g., `up::`, `top:`, `parent`)
- `format` — template for writing, must contain `{{link}}` (e.g., `up:: {{link}}`)
- `position` — where to place it: `connect_callout`, `frontmatter`, `top_of_body`, `end_of_frontmatter`
- `location_type` — `inline` (body pattern match) or `frontmatter` (YAML key)
- `multi` — whether multiple links are allowed (default: true for both parent and peer)
- `separator` — how multiple links are joined (default: `, `)

**Reading relationships:**
- `location_type: frontmatter` → parse YAML, look up the `marker` key
- `location_type: inline` → pattern match `^<marker>\s*(.+)$` in note body
- Extract all `[[...]]` wikilinks from the matched value

**Writing relationships by position:**
- `connect_callout` — inside a callout matching the `editable.connect` callout type; create the callout if it doesn't exist
- `frontmatter` — as a YAML key (string or list based on `multi`)
- `top_of_body` — first non-heading line after the frontmatter `---` fence
- `end_of_frontmatter` — last line inside the YAML block before closing `---`

**Multiple parents:** Allowed when `multi: true`. Most LYT vaults allow a note to belong to multiple MOCs.

**Self-links:** Invalid — skip and warn.

**Broken relationship links:** Treat as orphan candidates. Do not auto-remove.

**`connect_callout` requirement:** The referenced callout must be listed as `editable` in vault-config. Never write relationship content into a protected callout.

## Callout Classification

Callout tracking is optional. `callouts.enabled: false` → Tomo ignores all callouts and treats note content as flat markdown.

When `callouts.enabled: true`, every callout (`> [!name]`) is classified as one of three categories:

**Editable:** Tomo may read, insert, or update content.
**Protected:** Read-only. Never write inside (typically wraps DataviewJS/Dataview/plugin code — content is rendered at read time and would be overwritten or broken).
**Ignore:** Skip entirely — decorative or visual, no semantic value.

**Default for any unlisted callout:** `protected` (safe default — don't touch what you don't understand).

**Detection during `/explore-vault`:**
- Regex match `^> \[!(\w+)\]`
- Sample 10 occurrences per callout name
- Callout contains a code block → propose `protected`
- Callout contains only prose and wikilinks → propose `editable`
- Callout is empty → propose `editable`
- User confirms classifications

**Writing inside an editable callout:**
1. Locate the callout: scan for `> [!<name>]`
2. Find boundaries: all consecutive lines starting with `> `
3. Append or replace within the callout, preserving `> ` line prefixes
4. Preserve foldable state: keep `[!name]-` (collapsed) or `[!name]+` (expanded) suffix

**Creating an editable callout (when it doesn't exist):**
1. Insert at the target position (based on relationship config or template)
2. Write callout header: `> [!<name>] <optional title>`
3. Add content lines with `> ` prefix
4. Ensure blank line separation above and below

**Callouts with mixed content (prose + code block):** Treat as protected — cannot safely edit prose when code lives in the same callout.

**Nested callouts:** Write at the outermost callout depth unless the action specifies a nested target.

## Tag Taxonomy

The taxonomy lives in `vault-config.yaml` under `tags.prefixes`. Managed by `scripts/vault-config-writer.py tags` (schema: `tomo/schemas/vault-config-tags.schema.json`) — do not hand-edit.

Each prefix entry has five fields (all required):

- `description` — what this prefix category is for
- `known_values` — observed values under this prefix (full path beyond the prefix)
- `wildcard` — whether new values beyond known_values may be invented
- `proposable` — whether Tomo may actively propose this prefix at all. External taxonomies (Raindrop/, Readwise/, plugin-managed tags) get `proposable: false`. Combined with `required_for`, this gives three independent axes: Pflicht (`required_for`), Offenheit (`wildcard`), Aktivität (`proposable`).
- `required_for` — concept types that must have this prefix set

**Tag structure:** hierarchical slash-separated paths. Example: `type/note/normal`
- Prefix: `type`
- First segment: `note`
- Second segment: `normal`

**Wildcard: false** — Tomo only proposes tags from `known_values`. New values require explicit user approval before being added.

**Wildcard: true** — Tomo may propose new values under this prefix based on content analysis. New values added opportunistically to `known_values`.

**Tag assignment logic for proposals:**
1. Required prefixes first — for each prefix with `required_for` matching the note's concept type, find a value
2. Topic detection — classify note content against `topic` prefix known values; propose best match(es) with confidence scores
3. Status — default to `inwork` (or skip if not required and not explicitly set)
4. Project detection — if clearly project-related, propose `projects/<code>` tag

**Emoji in tags:** Valid Unicode characters, passed through unchanged. Comparisons are literal string matches.

**Tag normalization before writing:**
1. Remove leading `#` (frontmatter tags don't use `#`)
2. Trim whitespace
3. Preserve case (tags are case-sensitive in Obsidian)
4. Validate no spaces inside a tag
5. Validate no special chars except `/`, `-`, `_`, and emoji

**Unknown tags (outside taxonomy):**
- `wildcard: true` prefix → add to `known_values` automatically
- `wildcard: false` prefix → flag as taxonomy violation, ask user to add to taxonomy or fix the note

**No fitting prefix:** Don't invent new prefixes silently. Surface the question in the suggestions document. User approves before a new prefix is added.

**Duplicate tags at different depths** (e.g., `topic/ai` and `topic/applied/ai`): Flag during `/explore-vault`, user decides canonical form.

**Detection during `/explore-vault`:**
- List all unique tags via Kado `listTags`
- Group by prefix (first `/` segment)
- Count usage per value
- `required_for` detection: prefixes present on >95% of notes of certain types
- `wildcard` detection: many unique values under a prefix → `wildcard: true`; few values repeated heavily → `wildcard: false`
